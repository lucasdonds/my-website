        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my website! I am a Mechanical Engineering student
          at the University of Waterloo going into my second year of studies. I
          am interested in design, machines, programming, and above all creating!
          I am a person who likes to think outside of the box in order to find
          new and creative solutions to challenging problems. When working in
          groups, I find I often take the team lead and distribute work, trying
          to play to each individual members strengths, and ensuring everybody
          on the team is working on something interesting and challenging.
          However, I am not a controlling lead, I am actually super chill.
        </p>
        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p>
          So far I have two internships under my belt. For the first one, I was
          lucky to have a great placement at Skyjack - a subsidiary of Linamar -
          where I worked as a part of their large manufacturing engineering team!
          My main responsibilities during my 4 month term in there included
          managing and updating the plant layouts in order to improve flow and
          use of labour. I did this by taking lean manufacturing concepts into
          consideration, such as decreasing cycle time and making picking from
          warehousing more efficient. Additionally, I was a part of the team
          responsible for implementing new robotic equipment into the assembly
          line, which allowed for better use and reduction of labour. Overall, I
          thoroughly enjoyed my time at Skyjack and am very grateful for the
          opportunity they offered me, I learnt a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          My second placement was at WATiMake - an engineering clinic on campus
           focused on rapid prototyping. The clinic is open to all students on
           campus, but is focused on mechanical and mechatronics engineering.
           There, my responsibilities included maintaining and repairing the
           machines, - including 8 FDM and 2 SLA 3D printers, a laser cutter,
           vinyl cutter, and CNC machine - advising and helping students on
           their own projects, and working on a term project with my coworker.
           The term project was to make an active suspension system to
           demonstrate certain control systems concepts such as frequency
           analysis and harmonic damper. The project included learning concepts
           such as establishing serial connections between devices (Arduino and
           MATLAB) in order to collect data from the system, analysing the data,
          and designing the engageable active suspension components using a
          brushless dc motor.

          But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing
          pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
          account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
          explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one
          rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,
          but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
          encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
          anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
          because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
          which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a
          trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical
          exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
          right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
          has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces
          no resultant pleasure?
