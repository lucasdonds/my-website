# my-website

This project has the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website I intended to be my portfolio. Index+about is the main page and is linked to the other pages. This is the fourth website I made. I was planning on using a website as a personal portfolio, however I decided that making my portfolio a website might stop people from seeing it due to the extra steps of opening a website. The website is not complete.
